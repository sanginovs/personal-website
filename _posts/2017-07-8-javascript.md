&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often times, in my internship, I work on web-application issues that are related to **Javascript** and its famous library **JQuery**. The last time I worked with **Javascript** and **JQuery** was last year. So, I actually forgot some stuff. In the field of computer science, if you learn something but don't use it on you daily basis, you will forget it. That's what happened to my **JQuery** and **Javascript** knowledge. Thus, I thought I should go back and begin diving into some **Javascript**. That's what I did. Once I got off the work on Thursday, I came to my room, took an hour nap and began learning **Javascript** and **JQuery** at 6:00 PM. I worked on it until midnight and was able to learn quite a lot by also doing small projects to get my hands dirty with code. These days, when I learn some new programming language or some library, I feel like it's very easy for me to understand and I skim through things that I already know. Here's an example. I already know programming languages like Python, Java, C/C++, Ruby. There are a lot of common things among various programming languages. They all have loops, data-types, operators, etc. On the other hand, they have slightly different syntax, semantics, mutability, memory management, etc. That's why I feel like if you know one programing language very well, it'll be very easy for you to learn other languages.
