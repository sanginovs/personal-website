&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often times, in my internship, I work on web-application issues that are related to **Javascript** and its famous **JQuery** library. The last time I worked with **Javascript** and **JQuery** was last year. So, I actually forgot some stuff. In the field of computer science, if you learn something but don't use it on you daily basis, you will forget it. That's what happened to my **JQuery** and **Javascript** knowledge. Thus, I thought I should go back and begin diving into some **Javascript**. That's what I did. Once I got off the work on Thursday, I came to my room, took an hour nap and began learning **Javascript** and **JQuery** at 6:00 PM. I worked on it until midnight and was able to learn quite a lot by also doing small projects to get my hands dirty with code. I actually really liked it once I was able to do some cool animation on my website using **JQuery**. These days, when I learn some new programming language or some library, I feel like it's very easy for me to understand and I skim through things that I already know. Here's an example. I already know programming languages like Python, Java, C/C++, Ruby. There are a lot of common things among various programming languages. They all have loops, data-types, and operators. On the other hand, they have slightly different syntax, semantics, mutability and memory management. That's why I feel like if you know one programing language very well, it'll be very easy for you to learn other languages.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After learning **JQuery** and **Javascript**, on Friday, I picked on a major issue in one of our systems which required some **Jquery**. I felt very comfortable working on that issue using **JQuery** and I actually was able to fix it. Thus, I think there should be the right approach to solve a problem. I noticed some interns spend so much time on fixing bugs when they don't even understand the library which was used to implement the system. Oftentimes, they google the problem and hope some **Stackoverflow** answers show up. However, I realized one will be more comfortable working on fixing a bug if s/he is comfortable with its language. For example, if you are working on a bug that requires you to know **JQuery** library in order to fix it, you should start learning that library and not rely on **Stackoverflow**.
