&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I'm in the middle of week three and for the last 2-3 days, I've been learning Ruby programming language and Ruby web framework, Rails. I've heard good things about Ruby, so why not try it out since I took on the BART project last week which is built using Ruby on Rails. I started looking at the Ruby documentation and completed **"Lynda.com"** essential training on Ruby. When it comes to what I think about the actual language, I would say, **"the language is so weird syntactically but I get it."** At first, I was so confused with the syntax and slowly get the hang of it. I realized the syntax is the main difference among many programming languages. However, there are languages that have similar syntax. Ruby is an object-oriented programming language just like Python and everything is an object in Ruby. I think Ruby gives you a lot of freedom when it comes to modifying built-in libraries. Moreover, Ruby web framework Rails is very handy to work with. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, learning Ruby language has been very exciting. I'm actually learning new things every day. For me, computer science is a very broad field and there are so many things I still need to learn. I feel like my time is becoming very valuable to me since I started my internship. I made some changes with the way I spend my time. For example, I only allow myself to use social media 30 minutes per day. I feel like this method has been very productive. I realized that I became very good at managing my time. This is because I'm very busy with my internship work throughout the day, and I want to be as much productive as possible. Moreover, while working as an intern, I feel more like a professional software developer who is assigned a certain project and been given a deadline to complete it. Thus, I believe my internship has given me the real-world working experience and atmosphere.
