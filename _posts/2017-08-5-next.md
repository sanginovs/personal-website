&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is crazy, but I’m finally down to the last week of my internship. I cannot believe that it’s come down to the last of everything! I actually kind of feel sad because I really got used to my internship workspace and working atmosphere. It felt like I was working as a full-time software developer. The last two weeks have been pretty rough on me; I’ve been spending most of my time trying to finish up some new features on BART. However, I'm just trying to enjoy the last week of my internship. It was an amazing learning and hands-on experience. I gained  confidence, and determination when working on big projects. My passion to computer science has grown quite a lot and I also learnt new programming languages and tools.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, what is next for me career-wise?<br>
I'm a junior now. So, my next step is to get ready for the Fall semester. I'm taking 5 credits and four of them are CS courses. I can apply my learning from my internship to CS courses I'm taking in the Fall. My next goal is to do another internship in Spring 2018 in a large tech company. I am ready, I am confident and I am very passionate about anything related to computer science. One of the things I enjoy a lot is teaching students CS related topics. I might become 0-5 Teaching Assistant for some CS higher level course. I enjoy sharing my knowledge with others, and I really respect individuals who study a lot.
