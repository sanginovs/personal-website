&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week, I continued working on BART, Berea College Analytics and Reporting Tool. I managed to store huge datasets in a database replacing the yaml file which was temporarily used for storage. Soon, three other interns began working on BART. The first time you work on something is intimidating especially when you are not familiar with the web framework BART was built on. It takes a little time to familiarize yourself with the architecture, design and implementation. Since I started working on BART in the mid of my internship, I was put in charge of it. Moreover, I'm in charge of reviewing and merging pull requests. This is a big responsibility for me and a good learning experience at the same time. I realized some interns having a hard time with issues in BART. As a result, I thought it'd be better if we have a small meeting every morning to discuss our progress, ask for help and anything related to BART. Then, we had our first meeting and it went well. I answered their questions, learnt about the issues they were working on and gave some ideas on how to solve a specific issue. I feel like this helps interns to get comfortable with BART very quickly. Moreover, it's a good way to improve my leadership skills by taking a leading role in a team. When I first started working on BART, I was a little intimidated too because I did not know Ruby on Rails framework. After I learnt Ruby on Rails, the concepts became very simple and made sense. Thus, I realized how important it is to not give up when having a hard time with something. This is because, the more you learn, the more comfortable you get.
