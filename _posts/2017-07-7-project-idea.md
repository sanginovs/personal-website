&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the good things about my internship is that it also counts as my senior capstone.I have a choice: writing a 6-10 page technical documentation for any of our systems or doing a research paper. I chose to do a research paper because I like researching and learning new things. Next week, I have to submit the topic of my research paper and the whole paper is be due August 11th. Thus, I wasn't sure what topic to choose and wanted to schedule a meeting with my internship instructor Scott Heggen to discuss some ideas.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hours before meeting with my instructor, a brilliant idea came to my mind. I've always been interested in the topic of design and architecture. I've always wondered how companies like Facebook and Twitter designed the scalability of their systems since millions of users use Twitter and Facebook on a daily basis. I feel like it's a very important topic in software-engineering. Also, I realized this topic is relevant to an internship which I'm doing right now. Since we are building web-applications in my internship that are used by 1600+ Berea College students, faculty and staff, I thought it'd be interesting to do my research on designing scalable systems.  The keyword here is the scalability. Scalability is the capability of a system, network, or process to handle a growing amount of work, or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth. For example, let's say you have a personal website that normally has 20-30 visitors every day and is hosted on some web-server. What if president Trump calls out your name on some national television and all of a sudden, you become very popular and people start going to your personal website!? Will your website server be able to handle large amount of traffic and not crash? That's a good question to do some research on.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After meeting with Scott Heggen and talking about my topic, I was able to get a good starting point in my research paper. He suggested me that I should compare one of our application to some big-scale open source web application and find out the differences in design and architecture between the two. So far, I'm really passionate about this topic and I'm sure it'd benefit me in future. I think being able to design a scalable system is a very good skill for every software developer. Moreover, in order to get an internship in big tech companies like Google, Microsoft, you must know how to answer design interview questions. I feel like doing a research paper on designing scalable applications will soon benefit me in getting an internship in one of big companies in the summer of my junior year. Mark my words.
