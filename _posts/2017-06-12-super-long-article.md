Interning for computer science department of Berea College this summer is going to be full of learning experience. This is what I had expected from it and looks like I happened to be right about it according to my first day interning for Scott Heggen, Berea College computer science professor.

First, let's talk about the internship atmosphere. We are team of 6 student interns who will be developing software for school throughout this summer. The team is led by Scott Heggen and Cody Myers, both Berea College faculties in the field of computer science. We are divided in a team of three which would give a pair each. My teammate is Jose Zindia, a rising senior and my good friend who is from the South Sudan, Africa.

Today was more like a brief introduction day to an entire internship cycle. Scott Heggen briefly discussed what we be working on throughout this summer. First, we were introduced to six live web applications, currently used by entire Berea College faculty members, built by students who work for school as software developers. This means all these web applications have customers and need to be maintained properly. By maintaining, I mean if there are issues with a software, they quickly need to be fixed by student programmers. I briefly describe each system:
1. Berea College Syllabus Repository (BCSR) - the web application system which is used by professors to upload syllabus for various courses at the beginning of each semester
2. Course Administrative Schedule (CAS) - the web application system that is used for course scheduling each semester by faculty and students.
3. Chemical Inventory System (CIS) - the web application that is used to store all the chemicals currently available at Berea College
4. Eddy - the web application which is used by students to register for different workshops going around the campus.
5. Advancement Office (AO) - the web application system that is used by faculty to request for banner. Requesting banners used to be in paper form which they turned into a web form via this application.
6. Berea College Labor Program (BCLP)- the web application system which allows Berea College staff and faculty members to submit labor status forms when hiring a student for a job position.


After being introduced to the systems, we quickly dived into a code and picked on a issue to work on. Me and Jose first learnt the architecture of the web application, and by the end of the day we were able to fix the issue. In BCSR system, the issue was that the last modified date of courses were on a military time which we turned into the 12 hour time. All of this reminds me more of an open-source ideology where the programmer learns by diving into the system and working on a specific issue. This could be challenging but at the same time, very rewarding. So far, I'm very excited and I'm ready to learn more and more.
