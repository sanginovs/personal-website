&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week, we were assigned to explore “Sugar Labs” individually. Sugar Labs is an open source software created for teachers and children. So, I decided to do some research on “Sugar Labs” online. The first thing I looked at is “Getting Involved” page on Sugar Lab’s website. According to the website, anyone is welcome to contribute to this project. One does not have to be a developer in order to contribute. Contributors can also be designers, content writers, translators, and educators. For example, designers work a lot on the front-end while translators translate the project into different languages. Compared to other open source projects I have looked at, Sugar Labs is very organized and offers variety of roles to contributors. Moreover, it looks easy-to-start project for beginners to contribute. Since I work as a student software developer for Berea College, the most applicable role for me would be contributing as a developer. Roles applicable for an open-source class I am taking can be a developer, designer, and content writer since our students come from different backgrounds. One thing I noticed is the difference of skillsets required for each role. For example, a developer role requires one to have certain technical skills like Python, C, GTK+, git, packaging, bug filing, tracking and testing, JavaScript, web app development and GNU/Linux system administration while the designer role requires one to know Inkscape, GIMP, other vector & raster graphics tools, OpenOffice, design and usability/interaction. However, one common thing among all contributors is that they are contributing to the same project.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next thing I’ve looked at is Sugar Lab’s bug tracker. I have a good knowledge of version control; using Git/Github. When it comes to tracking bugs, I often use Github’s issue tracker. Similarly, Sugar Labs uses Github to track its bugs. The process of reporting a bug in Sugar Labs is very simple. One has to visit Sugar Lab’s Github repository, click on the Issue’s tab and creating a new issue. Currently, there are 12 issues (tickets) which were created by contributors. These issues have not been approved yet by Sugar Lab’s project manager. There are different categories of issues in Github. The three main categories are defects, task, and enhancement. These categories prioritize issue tracker. Defect issues are higher in priority compared to enhancement issues. Moreover, there are other information like whether a ticket is accepted, reopened or new. When it comes to commits, Sugar Labs has 7807 commits in total. The most recent commit dates back to Aug 4th, 2017.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The release cycle of Sugar Labs is also very straightforward. At the beginning of each release cycle, maintainers will work on a set of goals, document them and assign owners. Each release cycle will include development, beta, release candidate and final releases. The release team is responsible to coordinate with module maintainers, pull the updated modules together, perform basic QA and announce it. Similarly, the roadmap of Sugar Labs has a detailed schedule of the release dates and reference to new proposals.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most important key to success in an open source community is communication among all the contributors. Two of the most common means of communication in Sugar Labs is Internet Relay Chat and Mailing Lists. Most of the communications take place in IRC which is used for group communication and data transfer which works on a client/server networking model. On the other hand, with the mailing list, individual subscribers get the latest news and updates about Sugar Labs.
I really enjoyed Sugar Lab’s open source community by just taking a tour. The reason is that everything is neatly documented and easy to follow. I look forward to contributing to Sugar Labs in the near future.
