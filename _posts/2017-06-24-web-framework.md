&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of this week, I thought I should challenge myself and redesign on of the systems that we're currently working on now. I'm a challenger. If I work on something and find it not challenging, I think it's not worth of my time. Of course, I learn something from it but there should be a little bit of challenge. So far, I've been testing applications and trying to break them in order to find bugs. Moreover, I've been fixing all those bugs and issues that are found in the systems. I realized it's not a fun thing to do and I wouldn't want to do it all my life if I were a software developer. Also, I realized I'm more of a software developer who likes to design and build softwares from scratch rather than fixing bugs in the existing systems.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I talked to my internship instructor Scott Heggen and asked him whether I could redesign the whole CAS(Course Administrative Schedule) application. Then, Scott realized I was asking for some challenge. And he replied: <q>"Redesigning the systems is not a big priority now, but if you want a challenge..."</q>
