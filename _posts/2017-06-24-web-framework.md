&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of this week, I thought I should challenge myself and redesign on of the systems that we're currently working on now. I'm a challenger. If I work on something and find it not challenging, I think it's not worth of my time. Of course, I learn something from it but there should be a little bit of challenge. So far, I've been testing applications and trying to break them in order to find bugs. Moreover, I've been fixing all those bugs and issues that are found in the systems. I realized it's not a fun thing to do and I wouldn't want to do it all my life if I were a software developer. Also, I realized I'm more of a software developer who likes to design and build softwares from scratch rather than fixing bugs in the existing systems.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I talked to my internship instructor Scott Heggen and asked him whether I could redesign the whole CAS(Course Administrative Schedule) application. Then, Scott realized I was asking for some challenge. And he replied: <q>Redesigning our systems is not a big priority for now, but if you want a challenge...</q>
As a result, I was asked to work on a **BART** system that is currently not on production and needs a lot of work. **BART** is being built for the Labor Department at Berea college to perform analytics on results form the Student Labor Evaluations (SLE) and the Learning Experience Evaluations (LEE). Also, **BART** is designed to be used for any data source. Previously, the Labor Program has been generating these reports using a PHP script that creates a Microsoft word document based on a template. The department would then print hundreds of copies to distribute to labor supervisors across campus. I looked at it and I think, this system needs a lot of work and now it's roughly on 30%. I know it'd be challenging to me since I have to learn several new web frameworks, tools and dive into the existing source code. I feel like I can do it and I'm very excited to work on this system.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**BART** is built with **Ruby on Rails**, the framework which I haven't worked with yet. Moreover, it uses **Ajax**, **Javascript**, **Html**, **CSS**, etc. Learning new web frameworks is fun and I love it. I'm very comfortable working with Python web frameworks: **Flask** and **Django**. However, I never looked at Ruby web framework **Rails**. After I get some hands-on experience with Rails, I'd be able to compare it with Python web frameworks and see the design differences between these three web frameworks. I feel like it's a real challenge to me since I'm being exposed to new web frameworks which I've never worked with in my entire life.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second week comes to an end, I feel very confident in myself as an intern. I have a courage to take on big challenges and projects. I think, my internship is growing me as a software developer day by day. I'm being exposed to many technologies and tools, design and architecture, and lastly, the implementation.
