&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I was working on BART system this week, other interns were working on a system that was supposed to be finished by today. They actually did finish it today. The system is called "Eddy" and is built for Center of Transformative Learning Departement of Berea College to schedule meetings and workshops. Usually after building a web application, we spend some time doing usability tests on it with our customers. Thus, today we were scheduled to do a usability test with one of the CTL employees. First, what is a usability test? 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Usability testing is a way to see how easy to use something is by testing it with real users. Users are asked to complete tasks, typically while they are being observed by a researcher, to see where they encounter problems and experience confusion. For me, it was actually the first time doing the real customer usability test. I've done mock usability tests with my friends after creating several mobile apps which I built in my free time. Today, I was feeling a little nervous because I had to observe the whole process and make decisions regarding which parts of our web application were hard to use for our customer. First, I had to create scenarios for our customer to follow. This is one of the scenarios I wrote:
```
Task Scenario: 
Recently, you added a Civil Rights Seminar activity to Eddy as an admin. Two days later, you want to change some details about your activity. These are some details you’d like to change:
The type of your activity is more like a “Guest Speaker” activity.
The location of your activity has been relocated to Phelps Stokes
Currently, your activity is private. However, you want to make it public.
Last time, you didn’t add a note. Now, you want to add a note saying Free Food: pizza and cheesecake.”
```
