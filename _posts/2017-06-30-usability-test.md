&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I was working on BART system this week, other interns were working on a system that was supposed to be finished by today. They actually did finish it today. The system is called "Eddy" and is built for Center of Transformative Learning Departement of Berea College to schedule meetings and workshops. Usually after building a web application, we spend some time doing usability tests on it with our customers. Thus, today we were scheduled to do a usability test with one of the CTL employees. First, what is a usability test? 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Usability testing is a way to see how easy to use something is by testing it with real users. Users are asked to complete tasks, typically while they are being observed by a researcher, to see where they encounter problems and experience confusion. For me, it was actually the first time doing the real customer usability test. I've done mock usability tests with my friends before after creating mobile apps which I've built in my free time. I was feeling a little nervous because I had to observe the whole process and make decisions regarding which parts of our web application were hard to use for our customer.
