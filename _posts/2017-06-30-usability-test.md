&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I was working on BART system this week, other interns were working on a system that was supposed to be finished by today. They actually did finish it today. The system is called "Eddy" and is built for Center of Transformative Learning Departement of Berea College to schedule meetings and workshops. I wasn't working on Eddy because I noticed 4 people were already working on it. So, I felt like it'd be more beneficial for me to keep working on the system which I was working on already. Usually after building a web application, we spend some time doing usability tests on it with our customers. Thus, today we were scheduled to do a usability test with one of the CTL employees. First of all, what is a usability test? 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Usability testing is a way to see how easy to use something is by testing it with real users. Users are asked to complete tasks, typically while they are being observed by a researcher, to see where they encounter problems and experience confusion. For me, it was actually the first time doing the real customer usability test. I've done mock usability testings with my friends after creating several mobile apps which I built in my free time. Today, I was feeling a little nervous because I had to observe the whole process and make decisions regarding which parts of our web application were hard to use for our customer. First, I had to create scenarios for our customer to follow. This is one of the scenarios I wrote for our customer:
```
Task Scenario: 
Recently, you added a Civil Rights Seminar activity to Eddy as an admin. Two days later, you want to change some details about your activity. These are some details you’d like to change:
a)The type of your activity is more like a “Guest Speaker” activity.
b)The location of your activity has been relocated to Phelps Stokes
c)Currently, your activity is private. However, you want to make it public.
d)Last time, you didn’t add a note. Now, you want to add a note saying Free Food: pizza and cheesecake.”
```
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After writing several scenarios, we started a usability with CTL employee. She read the scenarios and quickly learnt how to navigate around **Eddy** web application. At the same time, I was quickly taking notes about the way she was using the system. After spending 30 minutes doing a usability test with her, we got enough feedback and suggestions which we will work on the following week. Communcating and working with customers is one of my internship experiences which I like so much. All the systems which we are working on right is being built for certain customers whom we report once a week. For me, it totally feels like a real-world freelance job where you build web-applications for customers. Isn't that amazing? I really like the way that the applcation which is built by me will be used by others. This really motivates me and makes me take my job seriously.
