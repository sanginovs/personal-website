&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven weeks of me doing summer internship have already passed. In this blog post, I'd compare the skills I gained from my summer internship compared to skills gained from taking CS courses. I feel like this kind of comparisons are important so other students who want to do internship know beforehand. I feel like most of the CS classes I took strengthened my fundamental knowledge of computer science. However, I realized the classes kind of lacked the practical, real-world teachings. There were some CS courses I took like Computer Networking where I built HTTP server protocol which was a hands-on experience. But, the majority classes I took taught me the fundamentals of computer science. One thing I realized is that fundamental knowledge of computer science made me a better software developer in my internship. For example, since I've taken 'Design and Analysis of Algorithm' course, I was very comfortable with writing efficient code. As a result, in my internship, I was able to apply my strong, fundamental knowledge of computer science to building a web application. The best thing about my internship is coding 8 hours a day which gives a feeling of what it is like to be a software developer. I don't get nervous anymore when I'm about to start a project from scratch. I know where to start and I know how to design and implement it. There are plenty of resources on the web that I free to use when starting a project. It's all about confidence and to get started. I believe my internship taught me independence and confidence when working on a real-world project while the CS classes I took strengthened my fundamental knowledge of computer science.
