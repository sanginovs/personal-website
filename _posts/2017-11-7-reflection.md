&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first two weeks in the open source community has been very challenging. This is because Firefox Debugger Html is written in REACT and I have never worked with REACT before. I and my team picked on a ticket right away. Our ticket is in accessibility category, so we had to add Aria-attributes to several places in the code. Aria-attributes are basically lines of code that makes user-interface more accessible to visually-impaired people.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I started working on this project, I knew I had to learn REACT before I dive into the source code. I went to REACT's official website and followed the tutorial. After spending several hours, I finally learned REACT. Once, I dived into the Debugger code, I felt kind of lost because the project is very big. It was very challenging to understand the architecture of an entire project. What I did was to trace each REACT components in every file since every component in REACT is connected to one another even if it's located in different files. After I got the hang of an architecture of the project, I started working on a ticket with my team. We got several of the Aria attributes working and we tested it by debugging the debugger which actually sounds funny since we are working on Firefox Debugger open source project.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My plan for the next two weeks is to pick another ticket and solve it. My goal is to do more independent study and get more comfortable working on this project. I feel like I do not benefit much if I only work on this project during the class. Working outside of class is my goal which will help me improve on my skills and be comfortable with the whole project overall. I am actually being more productive and saved some time in my schedule to work on Firefox Debugger project outside of class. Hope I stay motivated the entire time and keep contributing to this open source project.
