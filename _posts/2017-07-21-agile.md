&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's been 6 weeks so far, and the work-flow we follow is called an **"Agile Methodology"**. Agile is very important in software development that allows us to write software more efficiently. Moreover, it's important for team members to understand what it means to develop in an agile way. Agile is a set of values and principles software developing team should be follow in order to build software more efficiently. So, it's basically a collection of belief that team use to make decisions about how to do the work of developing software. Agile is an iterative cycle for several software developing methodology like having a short meeting every day with a developer team. Team meetings are very useful because interns talk about issues and features they are working on. It also allows us to discuss difficulties we're currently facing and get help from other interns.  I realized using agile methodology made my work more efficient and structured. Imagine how productive you are when you have to-do-lists every day. Same with developing a software using Agile principles.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most companies use Agile principles in their development environment. Working in an agile environment is one of the valuable professional lessons my internship's teaching me this summer. Now, I know what it feels like to develop software using agile methodologies. Moreover, it allows me to experience a professional real-world working environment where developers have power to do innovations. Finally, here is a list of an Agile cycle we follow each week:
1. Developing backlogs - meeting with customers every week to discuss new features and issues we are working on or simply write down their suggestions and opinion about the application.
2. Sprint - we then choose first-priority tasks and delegate in a team with whose working on which issue
3. Scrum - a small meeting which we have every day at 1:00 p.m.
4. Deploying - at this stage, some issues are fixed and will be pushed into production
As a result, this work-flow cycle is repeated over and over again.
