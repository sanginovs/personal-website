&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The internship environment I'm working on is very diverse. Diversity has always been very important to me. In 2013, I lived in California as an exchange student with an American host family. I represented my country and at the same time, encountered a lot of diversity in California. I feel like my exchange student year made me a very open-minded individual. I got to meet many people with different backgrounds. Two years after, I managed to get a full scholarship and study in of the most diverse institutions in America, Berea College.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my internship, I work with 5 other interns who come from different backgrounds. Sara and Evan come from America, Kenny from Haiti, Jonathan from Zimbabwe, Jose from South Sudan and me, from one of the former Soviet Union countries, Tajikistan. We all are born in different parts of the world and bring diverse cultural values and skill-sets to the table. I personally really enjoy it. The working environment reminds of some international corporation. I feel like a diversity fosters a more innovative and creative workplace. Moreover, it leads to a better discussion, decisions and outcomes. Here's an example. We usually work 8 hours a day and we often take 30 minute break and talk to one another about different topics in the world. For example, Jose started a conversation saying that he gets married when he is 40 years old. Then, all the interns stopped working on what they working on and got engaged in a conversation about marriage with Jose for 30 minutes. It was very interesting. As a result, the diversity plays an important role in my internship environment.
