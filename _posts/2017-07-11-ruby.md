&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This week began with us working on the same system we were working on last week.  After working on Eddy for eight hours on Monday, we managed to completely solve issues on it. Every time we take on a project, we usually have a deadline. I realized I'm more productive when there's a certain deadline to a project. I feel like I get less distracted by other things because of the responsibility to finish a project by certain time. Moreover, after completely finishing the project, I feel very satisfied and proud since the application we are working on is used by faculty, staff and students. It's a big responsibility, but at the same time a very valuable experience and personal knowledge growth for interns.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we are done with Eddy, we moved on to the next system which is Bart, the labor evaluation web application built with **Ruby on Rails.** I was assigned to work on Bart several weeks ago and I have pretty good knowledge of Bart and its implementation. Thus, this week, I play a leading role for the interns working on Bart to get them comfortable working on a system which they aren't familiar with. I feel like I've always been a leader. When taking several CS courses, we used to have teamwork projects. I remember being very active and leading my team to successfully finish the project by the end of the semester. I like answering questions and explaining computer science topics to students which sometimes make me want to become a Teaching Assistant in college. Interns who start working on Bart this week need to learn basics of Ruby programming language and its web framework Rails. It might take them couple days depending on how fast they learn. In my case, I really enjoyed learning Ruby language and I felt like I was really into learning new languages and web frameworks. What I love about learning new things is that it allows me to get various perspectives about a certain subject and I feel like it grows me as student.
