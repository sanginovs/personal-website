&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This week began with us working on the same system we were working on last week.  After working on it eight hours on Monday, we managed to completely solve issues on one of our web applications, Eddy. Every time we take on a project, we usually have a deadline. I realized I'm more productive when there's a certain deadline to a project. I feel like I get less distracted by other things because of the responsibility to finish a project by certain time. Moreover, after completely finishing the project, I feel very satisfied and proud since the application we are working on is used by faculty, staff and students. It's a big responsibility, but at the same time a very valuable experience and personal knowledge growth for interns.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we are done with Eddy, we moved on to the next system which is Bart, the labor evaluation web application built with **Ruby on Rails.** I was assigned to work on Bart several weeks ago and I have pretty good knowledge of Bart and its implementation. Thus, this week, I'm more like a project leader for the interns working on Bart.
