##### What motivates people to volunteer? How have similar motivations driven open source software communities? <br>

##### Discuss whether or not this essay is deserving of its own Wikipedia article? <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Homesteading the Noosphere** is an essay written by Eric Raymond who talks about motivations in the software hacker culture. Raymond highlights various hacker attitude ranging from those who misuse the software with evil intentions whom he calls "crackers" to those who build software and share their knowledge. He argues that monetary compensations is not a big motive for hackers, rather reputation is the desired commodity for them when building or contributing to a software.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From my perspective, there are several reasons that makes people volunteer. One of the reasons people volunteer is because it meets their need. They either enjoy it or gain something from it. For example, you like racing cars, and they invite you to volunteer at NASCAR race. You will definitely attend the race and volunteer. This is because you love sports-cars and you enjoy volunteering for this particular reason. Similar motives exist when contributing to an open source software. You either like the project or want to connect with the community or it could be some other reason. When a lot of people gather and do something, you are more likely to join them. You might notice a popular open source project out there and start contributing to it. Personally, I want to contribute to an open source software because I enjoy programming and want to be part of a larger community. Open source software is used by lots of companies; so your contribution actually matters.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, after reading Raymond's essay, I think it should have its own Wikipedia article. It is a very long essay and some of things he's saying matters. But also, there are some that are not that important. It's up to the reader to decide. You can read the <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/homesteading/">article</a> if you want to.
