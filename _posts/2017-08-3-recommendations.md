&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interning for Computer Science department of Berea College as a software developer has been very rewarding to me. I learnt a lot of new things and gained hands-on experience building web applications for school. There are several recommendations I'd give to other students who want to do this internship in the near future.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, knowing several programming languages are necessary. There are various web applications which you will be working on that are implemented in different programming languages such as Python, C# and Ruby. Thus, intermediate coding skills are necessary. For example, when I started this internship, I knew several programming languages like Python, Java and C. I realized knowing more than one programming language is very beneficial, and it makes learning a new language a lot easier. In my internship, I had to learn Ruby language on my own.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of my favorite habits is self-studying. I believe it makes me a better software developer. There are many useful materials out there which you have to study on your own. For example, in my internship, we use Git version control for our projects and several other web frameworks that are essential for building web applications. I started using version control way before I started my internship and had an intermediate knowledge of web frameworks. That is why, working on personal projects using various tools is very important. It gives you a hands-on experience and at the same time, a chance to learn new softwares, and tools.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there are certain characteristics that are very important for you to have during your internship. The most important thing for a good software developer is to have a passion for what you are doing. In my internship, I had to code 8 hours a day. So, if you are not passionate about coding, you won't be able to handle it. Next, you should be determined. When developing software, you get to work on things which will take a lot of time especially when you are detecting software bugs(it is frustrating by the way). Thus, you need sound determination to cope with these tasks. Moreover, you should be a team player because you get to work in a team a lot. Finally, always stay confident and manage your time efficiently.
