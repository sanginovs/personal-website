&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm very comfortable with Ruby language and Rails framework now after spending two days on learning the language itself. Thus, it was the right time for me dive into BART system. The first problem I ran into was running the system itself and being able to run a migrate file in order to create tables in MySQL database. After spending an hour debugging and googling things, I was able to fix the problem and run the system. I feel like being patient is crucial when you are dealing with some technical issues. A lot of times people get frustrated and give up. I remember I was like that when I stepped into programming world for the first time. Today, I often think back and realize how much I grew as a programmer. That is why, patience is a key. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After successfully running the system, I ended up in a homepage. The first step in using BART system is to upload the **Excel** datasets and the system parses Labor Evaluation information from the spreadsheet using **Ruby Roo** library. However, I got another error when I uploaded the **Excel** dataset into the system. I worked on fixing the issue for a bit. After multiple failed attempts, I decided to take a break because I was very stressed and tired at the same time. Working 8 hours a day with computers is not a joke. I noticed I often get a headache if I work for 7-8 hours without taking an hour break. This has negative longterm effects on my health and wellness. Thus, I realized I should be taking 10-15 minute breaks every hour to refresh my eyes and take a brisk walk. Moreover, I found several tips that help me stay healthy while working with computers all day. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was able to reach Robert Hosking who previously worked with BART system. I asked for his help so he give me a clue about the bug I was trying to fix. After discussing the issue with him, we were able to fix it. I realized that communication is very important in my working environment. It's like you struggle a lot with some bug, then you find a friend who can easily solve the problem for you because he already encountered a similar issue before. I realized that asking people for help is something which I should do very often.
