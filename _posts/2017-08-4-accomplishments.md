&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's been 8 weeks since I started my internship, and it has been a great learning experience. In this blog, I discuss my goals which I accomplished in my internship. There were certain things I wanted to do before starting my internship. One of my goals was to build a scalable web application from scratch. However, at the beginning of my internship, I mostly worked adding features to web applications that were already built. I wanted a challenge. As a result, my internship instructor assigned me to work on building Berea College Labor & Analytics tool(BART) in Ruby on Rails. I accepted a challenge.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the benefits of building a web application from scratch is the learning experience. The structure of a big scalable web application is very complex. One needs to consider different design techniques and architecture before building an application. Thus, I felt like it'd be a great learning experience that would allow me to learn about design side of web applications. I didn't have a solid knowledge of design and architecture before I started my internship. Moreover, I realized the importance of design and architecture when building a software. As a result, while working on BART, I learnt about architectural patterns like Model-View-Controller and database design techniques such as requirements analysis, data modeling, and normalization.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout my internship, my goal had become to gain as much knowledge as possible by solving various problems. Fortunately, I managed to accomplish this goal. I learnt so many things step by step while building an application. For example, there were times where I wanted to use asynchronism to make the application more scalable. However, I had no idea how to implement it. After doing some research, I was able to implement it. I realized it is very important for a software developer to have patience, confidence and determination when working on a big project.
