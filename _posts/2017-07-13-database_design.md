&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of my goals for this week is to use a database to store all the datasets which are currently stored in a .yaml file in the Bart web application. I have a good knowledge of databases since I used Sqlite, MySql and Postresql database for my side-projects. However, there are several areas of database modeling and design that have been slightly confusing to me. I felt like I should take a database course in order to strengthen my knowledge in this area. That's why I'm enrolled in a database class this upcoming Fall 2017. I feel like having a good knowledge about databases is very important these days. All tech companies handle big data, and they use database concepts to store it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, I've done some research about relational database mappings and modeling. I'm working on designing a model that represents Excel datasets consisting of columns and rows. Moreover, I have to do some research about creating models with foreign keys in Ruby on Rails. I'm just going to read Rails documentation for that. I don't have a teammate to work with on Bart yet since other interns have just started learning Ruby on Rails framework. However, I often ask other interns questions about database mappings and modeling. Even though they are new to Ruby on Rails, they can suggest some good ideas about the design part. That is why communication is very important in computer science. If you take many ideas and views and merge it into one, you get the best out of all. Thus, I like getting other people's perspectives on the same topic.
