&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second week of my internship started and I feel confident after being in a struggle mode throughout my first week. One thing I learnt from the last week is to ask my peers for things that don't make sense to me when it comes to fixing bugs. I feel like I heavily rely on websites like **Stackoverflow**(technical question & answer website) when I'm having technical problems. Sometimes, it does make sense to ask other interns for help when facing a problem which I rarely did in the first week. This is one of my weaknesses. I realized that I should be asking other interns for help when I get stuck on something.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week, we are focusing on learning different architectural design patterns like Model-View-Controller. Being able to design a web application system is not an easy task and requires some planning especially when your application becomes popular all of a sudden. I feel like I've never designed a big scale application from scratch and this is one of the skills which I'm trying to gain from my internship this summer. I remember working on my **Mail Server** personal project and implementing it from scratch. I did quite a bit designing on that project. However, I did not design it as a large scale application since no one will ever use my mail server in real life. For me, designing big applications is a puzzle and a mystery to solve and it is **FUN**.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Model-View-Controller design pattern is used in most of our web applications which have been implemented so far. So, it's very important for interns like me to really have a deep understanding of this design pattern in order to understand the structure of the web applications in which we are  working on this summer. I'm the type of computer programmer who likes to learn new things every day. A month ago, when I started preparing for coding technical interviews, I thought it'd be a good idea to learn about designing applications. Thus, I learnt about Model-View-Controller design pattern at that time just for fun. But, now I'm here interning and we are being taught about the **MVC**'s which is good and I feel like I already know that stuff but I enjoy learning more about this design pattern.
