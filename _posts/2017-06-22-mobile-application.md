&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the responsibilities which I have as an intern is to meet with customers and talk about what they want on their web or mobile application. I'm not an expert in negotiating with customers but I have one year experience working at the service desk of Seabury Center Gymnasium where I often had to communicate with customers in my daily basis.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week I had a chance to meet with several employees of the **Public Safety Department** of Berea College who wanted us to build a mobile application that has some safety features for college students like notifying the Public Safety when the student is in danger via one click. Personally, I feel like **Public Safety** mobile apps aren't that popular among college students since majority of college students have a dislike towards the employees of this department because of parking policies and ticketing. There is no point of putting so much work into building the best mobile application ever but having a very few users. In my opinion, it is a waste of time and effort. That is why, ideas are very important. Best ideas grow your business while bad ideas will waste your resources.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought it'd be better to include some other features from other departments in the proposed mobile app like dining service hours, gym schedule which could get Berea college students download the app. However, we needed good ideas. I thought if our customers are college students, why not just ask them. Thus, I went on Facebook posted a poll in order to see what Berea students want:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, I was able to gather several good ideas from the poll for the proposed app which we build once our instructor Scott Heggen approves it. If it gets approved, then I think the next step would be to learn different tools that could be used to build the app. One of the frameworks we were planning to use is called **NativeJS**, a Javascript framework which is used to build Android and IOS applications. I have not looked at it yet but it wouldn't be hard to learn. When I first started my journey into computer science world, I often found myself lost when I looked at the documentation of new libraries and frameworks. This is because documentation were very confusing to me. Those documentations were not beginner-friendly and confused a beginner even more. But, now I feel very comfortable reading documentations and understanding how certain tools or libraries work. I feel like with age comes wisdom. I often have to go look at documentations these days for my internship and I'm really glad that I understand them. In the area of computer science, if you don't understand something, it becomes very depressing. Not giving up and asking questions about the problem is a key.
