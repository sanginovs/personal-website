&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second week of my internship started and I feel confident after being in a struggle mode throughout my first week. One thing I learnt from the last week is to ask my peers for things that don't make sense to you when it comes to fixing bugs. I feel like I heavily rely on websites like **Stackoverflow**(technical question & answer website) when I'm having technical problems. Sometimes, it does make sense to ask other interns for help when facing a problem which I rarely did in the first week. This is one of my weaknesses. I realized that I should be asking other interns for help when I get stuck on something.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week, we are focusing on learning different architectural design patterns like Model-View-Controller. Being able to design a web application system is not an easy task and requires some planning especially when your application becomes popular all of a sudden. I feel like I've never designed a big scale application from scratch and this is one of the skills which I'm trying to gain from my internship this summer.
