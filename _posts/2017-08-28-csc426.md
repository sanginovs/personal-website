&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nowadays, open source is becoming very popular and a lot of programmers are contributing to open source projects. Last semester, Tom Callaway, an open source software developer from RedHat had a presentation in my school about an open source software and community. That was the time I became familiar with an idea of an open source and after doing a lot of research on my own, I really wanted to contribute to an open-source project. However, I had a difficult time choosing the right open-source project and even after choosing one, I was confused looking at its source code. The software I was trying to contribute to was "Tensorflow".

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, this is one of the reasons I am taking an Open Source Software Engineering class this semester taught by Emily Lovell. My goal is to gain confidence and skills that help me get started with contributing to open source projects. When it comes to my experience with an open source, I haven't actually contributed to any open source software out there. However, I understand the way contributing to an open source projects work. This is because, oftentimes, I worked on class projects in teams, and we used to use Git as a version control for our project. Each team member had to work on a branch, and we had a master branch on Github. We used to create pull requests when submitting patches, and one of us was in charge of reviewing pull requests and pushing them to master. Contributing to an open source works the same way. Usually, you claim an issue and work on it on a separate branch. Once you are done, you usually create a pull request and submit your branch. Once it is reviewed, your patch could either get denied or pushed to master branch.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I work as a student software developer for Computer Science Department at Berea College. I've learned a lot about software development while working for CS department. Thus, I could bring some of my strongest skills to my team in my Open Source class this semester. As I've just mentioned, I have a good grasp of version control tools like Git, Github and Bitbucket. Moreover, I am very comfortable with developing web applications using various web frameworks like Django, Flask,and Ruby on Rails. Also, an open source class I am taking this semester is a great chance for me to improve upon my skills by working on projects that are implemented in new programming languages and tools that I am not familiar with like Angular JS, NodeJS, etc. So, this is one of my goals; to contribute to an open source project while not being familiar with its language and tools. In order to achieve my goal, I will work hard and learn these new tools on my own. There are plenty of materials and documentations on the Internet that can be helpful to achieve my goal. Finally, even after taking this class, I want to keep on contributing to open source projects.
