&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I finally managed to replace the Yaml file with MySQL database to store all the data in Bart application. The database design, modeling and mapping took me several days. After I finished the design, I started implementing it. I realized the importance of a good design in database. Designing a good database allows an easy and efficient retrieval of data. After implementing the actual working code, I usually test it. I realized how testing is important in software development which I did not know before. You should test each function using various number of inputs and try to break it. Even though unit testing is an extra cost, it actually reduces the number of bugs released in production. Back in the days, when I took CS courses, we didn't do much with unit-testing. Now, I know why. This is because unit-testing is often used for larger projects since it can ensure that new additions and changes to large projects donâ€™t interfere with other sections of the code.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After testing my code with a very large data, I realized I needed to find a way to make my database implementation more efficient. Importing all that data into a database took 15 minutes in total which is not that efficient. For example, number of datasets that got inserted into a dataset table was 20208 while number of rows inserted into Rows table was 88975. Working with big data is really exciting. I've never worked with so much data before and now I know what it feels like. It was a good learning experience. After you test your code with large inputs, then you realize how efficient your code is. It takes me back to my Algorithm class from the last semester when we analyzed different efficiency of algorithms. The knowledge of algorithm is actually very helpful to me since it helps me to implement the database data insertion more efficiently.
