&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five weeks have passed and I'm halfway in my internship already. So far, it's been a lot of learning experience and I've been working on real-world projects. I remember I've always wanted to work on big projects like building a web application from scratch but I did not know where to start. But now, I can proudly say that I'm able to build web application from scratch using Python or Ruby web frameworks. Also, I learnt how to manage my time effectively. For example, during my internship, I realized that I need to work on a side project just for a learning experience and my resume. Thus, while managing my time effectively, I was able to finish my "building a Compiler from scratch" side-project. Moreover, I learnt about many web frameworks such as Flask and Ruby on Rails. Also, I learnt how to design a web application using Model-View-Controller system which I did not know before. Being able to design a scalable system is crucial in computer science. Thus, I even decided to do my research paper on this topic after learning about the concepts of design and architecture. I feel like I'm very confident working on big projects now than I used to be. I feel like I became well-rounded, learnt different tools, design techniques, database concepts and version control. It's been a great learning experience so far.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What am I expecting from the upcoming five weeks? I feel like I need couple more weeks to strengthen and build up on the concepts which I've learnt and worked with so far. Moreover, I'm open to learn new tools or tackle new projects but it's up to my internship instructor, Scott Heggen. We have several web applications that are built with .NET framework. Maybe, I'd tackle that. Will see.
