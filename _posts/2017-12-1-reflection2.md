&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the last two weeks of my open source class and we would like to wrap things up taking care of everything. If you've read my previous blog, we created a pull request for our issue last week. Our pull request got reviewed after several days by Jason Laster, and Yura who left some feedback on our code and requested some changes:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the drawing board. We had to make certain changes in our code which were not mentioned in the issue itself. We followed the same "Divide and Conquer" strategy and started working on the changes Yura requested from us. We were able to finish 4 out of 6 requested changes. However, we got stuck on the last two. One thing I realized is that communication is a key in the open source community. After you do enough research on a blocker but still not able to figure the solution, it is important that you reach our to the community. That is what we did. One of our teammates, Vincent Davis reached out to Yura, the maintainer, to clarify certain things: <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Yura explained how to do certain things, we were now clear on how to fix the last two requested changes but we are also at the last week of our open source class. Even though we are not completely done with our pull request, I took a responsibility to complete the last two requested changes. As a result, I am planning to continue my contribution to Mozilla's Debugger open source project. This is because the front-end is built on React and I love React. Secondly, the community is very user-friendly and responsive. There are two ways of reaching out to them: use their Slack channel or just comment under your bug on Github after you claimed it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire semester of my open source class has been very adventurous, and I learned new technologies and the open source workflow. Before taking this class, I often felt intimidated to contribute to open-source projects because I did not know where to start. After being engaged in the Mozilla's open source community for the entire semester, I now feel comfortable reaching out and exploring other open source communities. I certainly continue contributing to Firefox Debugger project, and I am very thankful for my professor and my open source class and also, thank you Mozilla, for an organization logo on my Github page:<br>
