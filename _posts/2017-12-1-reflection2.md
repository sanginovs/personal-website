&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two weeks are the last two weeks of my open source class and we would like to wrap things up taking care of everything. If you read my previous blog, we created a pull request for our issue last week. Our pull request got reviewed after several days by Jason Laster, and Yura who left some feedback on our code and requested some changes:
