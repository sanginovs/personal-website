&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two weeks are the last two weeks of my open source class and we would like to wrap things up taking care of everything. If you read my previous blog, we created a pull request for our issue last week. Our pull request got reviewed after several days by Jason Laster, and Yura who left some feedback on our code and requested some changes:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the drawing board. We had to make certain changes in our code which were not mentioned in the issue itself. We followed the same "Divide and Conquer" strategy and started working on the changes Yura requested from us. We were able to finish 4 out of 6 requested changes. However, we got stuck on the last two. One thing I realized is that communication is a key in the open source community. After you do enough research on a blockers but still not able to figure the solution, it is important that you reach our to the community. That is what we did. One of my teammates, Vincent Davis reached out to Yura, the maintainer, to clarify certain things:
