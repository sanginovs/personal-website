&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing usability test last Friday, we were able to find several issues on our web-application, Eddy. Thus, I created issue queues and assigned them to everyone so we get it done early. Since we work in a team and at the same projects, we use **Bitbucket** as a version control. Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. The idea of version control is not new to me. I've been using version control for a while now. Thus, I don't find it difficult to get the concept of the version control because it might confuse the beginners. I remember self-studying version control a while back when I was a freshman. They didn't actually teach it in any of my classes. However, my roommate was really good in these concepts. Out of curiosity, I always asked him about these topics and did some research on my own. Now, I feel like self-studying topics that aren't taught in class actually put me ahead of other students in the field of computer science. When it comes to version control, I first started using **Git** and **Github** as a version control for my personal projects. **Git** is a revision control system, a tool to manage your source code history while **Github** is a website and a hosting service for Git repositories or folders. So they are not the same thing: Git is the tool, GitHub is the service for projects that use Git. On the other hand, **Bitbucket** is just like Github and uses **Git** however there's a slight difference. In **Github**, creating public repositories is free of charge while creating private repositories for your projects is not free. On the other hand, **Bitbucket** allows you to create unlimited private repositories for free but charges money for creating public repositories. That's why we use **Bitbucket** in my internship instead. It allows us to create private repositories for our web applications like Eddy, Advancement systems for free. Version control is a very important topic especially in software engineering and I feel like every CS student should know about it and hosts his/her projects on Github. Here's a link to my **Github** account if you want to see what I'm talking about: <a href="/github.com/sanginovs">**github.com/sanginovs**</a>
