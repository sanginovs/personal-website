&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing usability test last Friday, we were able to find several issues on our web-application, Eddy. Thus, I created issue queues and assigned them to everyone so we get it done early. Since we work in a team and at the same projects, we use **Bitbucket** as a version control. Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of version control is not new to me. I've been using version control for a while now. Thus, I don't find it difficult to get the concept of the version control because it might confuse the beginners. I remember self-studying version control a while back when I was a freshman. They didn't actually teach it in any of my classes. However, my roommate was really good in these concepts. Out of curiosity, I always asked him about these topics and did some research on my own. Now, I feel like self-studying topics that aren't taught in class actually put me ahead of other students in the field of computer science. When it comes to version control, I first started using **Git** and **Github** as a version control for my personal projects. **Git** is a revision control system, a tool to manage your source code history while **Github** is a website and a hosting service for Git repositories or folders. So they are not the same thing: Git is the tool, GitHub is the service for projects that use Git. On the other hand, **Bitbucket** is just like Github and uses **Git** however there's a slight difference. In **Github**, creating public repositories is free of charge while creating private repositories for your projects is not free. On the other hand, **Bitbucket** allows you to create unlimited private repositories for free but charges money for creating public repositories. That's why we use **Bitbucket** in my internship instead. It allows us to create private repositories for our web applications like Eddy, Advancement systems for free. Version control is a very important topic especially in software engineering and I feel like every CS student should know about it and should host his/her projects on Github. Here's a link to my **Github** account if you want to see what I'm talking about: <a href="https://github.com/sanginovs">**github.com/sanginovs**</a>
