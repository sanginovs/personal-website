&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reading chapter 3 of "The Art of Community" by Jono Bacon, I've learned different types of communication that can be beneficial in my open-source journey. Bacon discusses two types of communication: daily communication and longer writing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daily communication is day-to-day discussions where the team of developers, managers sit together and promote continuous communication between everyone everyday. For example, in class, my team and I are working on fixing this <a href="https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/issues/4071">bug</a> on Mozilla's Debugger open source project. At the beginning of each class, we have a small meeting on Slack where each team member talks about his/her accomplishments, blockers, and discussion topics. We call it a Scrum meeting. Thus, the scrum meeting is one type of daily communication which we are using in class. Moreover, Firefox Debugger Dev team has a Slack channel where contributors interact with each other, ask and answer questions. I joined this channel as I began contributing to Firefox Debugger, and I use it as my main source of getting help if I get stuck on something. The members of this channel are very helpful and informative especially Jason Laster who manages Firefox Debugger project. As a result, the Firefox Debugger Slack channel is another form of daily communication which I will be using throughout my journey in the open source world.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second type of communication which Bacon talks about in his essay is longer writing. According to Bacon, longer writing involves writing blogs, articles, essays, documentations and emails. For example, for my Open Source class, I am writing weekly blogs about my open source experience. Thus, writing blogs is one type of longer writing which is very useful in the open source community. I feel like people who are new to open source can read my blogs and get an idea of what it is like to be a part of open source community.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While daily communication and longer writing follow some basic communication rules, there are some key differences between these two styles of communication. Daily communication offers more of a personal experience and is effective, quick, clear and concise way of communicating and doesn't require one to follow some stylistic writing criteria. Unlike daily communication, longer writings require longer, more thoughtful,detailed and planned thoughts that are often used to inspire, advise, and direct community. Moreover, they are well-written and follow some particular stylistic criteria.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this reading, I've learned that communication is most importantly a way to maintain the culture of open source community in addition to interacting with one another. Moreover, there are certain culture in different open source communities and in the way they communicate. Thus, I'd like to learn the way contributors communicate in their channels and do my best to fit in their open source community.
