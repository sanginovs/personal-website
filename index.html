            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi. My name is "Sher", and it means "Lion" in my language, not Cher, the singer. I come from Tajikistan, one of the mountainous countries
            located in Central Asia. </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            In 2015, I was offered an admission to Berea College, located in Berea, KY,
             with four year full-tuition scholarship. Currently, I am junior studying computer science at Berea.
             At Berea, every student has a labor position as part of his/her education. Thus, I work as a Student Programmer
             building web applications which are used by faculites and students at Berea College.

      <h2>WORKING HARD IS A KEY TO SUCCESS</h2>
      <p>The passion in technology evolved in me since I was a child. I was always fascinated
      with how computers work. Then I started learning more about computers.
      That's when  I realized there was no magic involved in the process of computers.
       It was the result of hard work people put into it which took years to get what it's here
       today. </p>
      <p> By now, it should be clear why i majoring in computer science in college.
        So far, my journey in the field of computer science has been exciting. I learn something new every day.

        I'm a hard working individual and I always find myself working on various projects.
