            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi. My name is "Sher", and it means "Lion" in my farsi language, not Cher, the singer. I come from Tajikistan, one of the mountainous countries
            located in the Central Asia. </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            In 2015, I was offered four year full-tuition scholarship to attend Berea College which is located at Berea, KY.
            Currently, I am a junior studying computer science.
            Berea College is a work and study school; every student has a 15 hour labor position related to his/her major each semester.
            Thus, I work as a Full-Stack Student Software Developer in a team of 8 building
            web applications that improve the administrative workflow of various Berea College departments.
            My goal is to make a positive impact in my community and enhance the lives of people
            using the power of technology.

          </p>

      <h2>WORKING HARD IS A KEY TO SUCCESS</h2>
      <p>The passion in technology evolved in me since I was a child. I was always fascinated
      with how computers work. Then I started learning more about computers.
      That's when  I realized there was no magic involved in the process of computers.
       It was the result of hard work people put into it which took years to get what it's here
       today. </p>
      <p> By now, it should be clear why i am majoring in computer science in college.
        So far, my journey in the field of computer science has been very exciting. I learn something new every day.

        I'm a hard working individual, and I always find myself working on various side projects. Moreover,
        working on side projects is fun and exciting.
